/*
 * This script implements a morality about fairness. Two people, Jery and Gerge, may or may not receive IPADs.
 * The morality states that Gerge should:
 *
 *  1. be happy if they both get an IPAD.
 *	2. be sad if one of them gets an IPAD but not the other.
 *
 * If neither of them gets an IPAD the morality does not apply, meaning those cases are flagged as neutral.
